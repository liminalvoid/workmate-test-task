### Options

options:

### How to add new report

You can add new report as a function in the `reports.py` file. It will be automatically parsed and then you can use it by passing report name as an argument.

**Note:** report function name must start with the `report` keyword. Also `report` keyword will be deleted after parsing and underscores will be replaced with dashes (e.g. `report_average_rating` will be `average-rating`, `report_average_price` will be `average-price` etc).
